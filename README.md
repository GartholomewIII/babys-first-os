# What is This?

In an attempt to learn more about what goes on behind the endless layers of abstraction.
I will be creating my very own operating system. This README will serve as a kind of documentation on things I learn.
I will be writing down every new discovery, definition and documenting what breaks.
In the beginning I will be using the OSdev Wiki to guide me in creating a 'bare-bones' OS

Today we are compiling! And its successful! I have attached an image below showing what the QEMU virtual machine looks like with the kernel running.

### What I've learned:

I've learned what bootloaders are. Bootloaders are the first thing that is ran when you power on a computer and it loads the main OS in memeory.
OS development requires a LOT more reasoning than simple web/desktop development where 90% of the effort is on the GUI.
I've also learned that Linux really is the only platform you can realistically develop an operating system.

#### Goals for next session:

Get the OS to play a song
